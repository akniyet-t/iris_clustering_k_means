# K-Means Clustering on Iris Dataset

## Overview
This project applies the k-means clustering algorithm to the famous Iris dataset, specifically targeting petal width and length for identifying inherent patterns and groupings.

## Objective
The primary goal is to cluster Iris flowers based on their petal characteristics using the k-means algorithm.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is used, consisting of measurements for sepal and petal width and length across three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Implementation
The k-means algorithm is implemented using Python and scikit-learn. The focus is on petal width and length as key features for clustering.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Run the clustering script (`python kmeans_clustering.py`).

## Results
The clustering analysis reveals patterns in the Iris dataset, providing insights into the inherent structure based on petal width and length.
